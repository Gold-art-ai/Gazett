            <p class="drop-cap">Streetwear is the trendiest topic and talk of the town. Contrary to traditional fashion, streetwear focuses on individuality and personality. As a result, it has revolutionized modern style.</p>

            <blockquote class="pull-quote">Forget the rules—streetwear isn’t just for guys! Girls are redefining the scene with bold, oversized fits, sneaker culture, and statement accessories.</blockquote>

            <blockquote class="pull-quote">“Fashion is simply from the heart. Be stylish only from the inside.”</blockquote>

            <h2>IT'S HISTORY</h2>
            <p><b class="b">S</b>treetwear didn’t begin in fashion houses or luxury runways. It was born on the sidewalks of Los Angeles in the 1980s — shaped by the voices of skateboarders, surfers, hip-hop heads, and rebels. One of the pioneers was Shawn Stüssy, a surfboard maker who began printing his signature logo on T-shirts. These shirts exploded in popularity, and without realizing it, he helped ignite a cultural revolution. Soon after, hip-hop culture in New York added its own flavor — think oversized jackets, bucket hats, and sneakers that told stories of struggle and resilience.</p>

<p>Throughout the 1990s and early 2000s, brands like Supreme, FUBU, A Bathing Ape (BAPE), and Rocawear took center stage, transforming streetwear into a global language of identity. And it wasn't just about fashion — it was about representing where you come from. It was about standing tall even if the world didn’t see your worth. As the 2010s rolled in, streetwear collided with luxury — think Louis Vuitton x Supreme or Off-White under Virgil Abloh’s vision. But even with fame and designer labels, streetwear never forgot its roots.</p>

<p><i>"I remember wearing my first pair of Jordans in high school,"</i> shares Ruby Kamanzi, a Kigali-based fashion blogger. <i>"They weren’t just shoes. They made me feel powerful. Like I had a voice in a world that barely listened."</i></p>

<p>Today, the movement has grown beyond borders. In cities like Kigali, Nairobi, and Accra, streetwear is a mirror of youth energy — fearless, vibrant, and proud of culture. African designers are weaving tradition into modern aesthetics. Kente prints on bomber jackets, Ankara joggers, and beadwork sneakers? That’s not just fashion — that’s history being rewritten in style.</p>

            <h2 class="phy">Beauty & Self-Care Tips</h2>
            <p>Beauty in the streetwear scene is raw and unfiltered. It’s not about hiding imperfections — it’s about celebrating what makes you *you*. Start with the basics: skin. A good skincare routine is non-negotiable. Cleanse, tone, moisturize, and never skip sunscreen. Melanin is magic, but it still needs protection!</p>

<p><b>Hydrate & Moisturize:</b> Kigali-based model Tracy Uwimana swears by a simple combo: shea butter and rose water. <i>“It’s natural, affordable, and keeps my skin soft all day,”</i> she says. Don’t underestimate the power of drinking enough water too — glow starts from the inside.</p>


<p><b>Minimalist Makeup:</b> The new rule? Less is more. Go for dewy skin, clear brows, and a little shimmer on the eyelids. Lip gloss is back — thick, juicy, unapologetic. Makeup artist Blessing Ntirenganya adds, <i>“My favorite look? A fresh face with bold eyeliner. It’s soft but screams confidence.”</i></p>


<p><b>Nail Trends:</b> Long or short, clean nails are a must. Pastel colors like lilac, mint, and peach are having a moment. But don’t shy away from metallic chrome or graphic prints. Nail artist Shanice from Nyamirambo tells us, <i>“I had a client who got her nails done to match her favorite graffiti spot. That’s the thing about street beauty — it’s expressive, artistic, and deeply personal.”</i></p>

<p>Lastly, self-care is more than skin-deep. Take breaks from social media, rest well, and wear what makes you feel good. Because beauty is a vibe — and your vibe is unmatched.</p>

            <p><b>Minimalist Makeup</b> – Glossy lips, fluffy brows, and a touch of blush = effortless beauty.</p>
            

            <p><b>Nail Trends</b> – Go for pastel nails, chrome finishes, or graphic designs.</p>
